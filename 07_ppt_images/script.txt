first we learned basic concepts of ai/ml 
first different traditional algorithm and ai/ml
traditional algorithm is deterministic algorithm that is same input same output
but ai/ml is non deterministic algorithm for train model. and trained model is deterministic

and problem that ai/ml solve
first classification is select class for example, cancer/no cancer, dog/cat
next, regression solve problem with continuous value for example house price
and Game for example go, chess, pac-man et cetera

next we learned basic ml pipeline/workflow
first, load data
next preprocessing,
in preprocessing we can do normalization/ standardization, so we can ignore units
and handle missing values for example delete row, take mean ..et cetera (etc)
next EDA(exploratry data analysis)/visualization
next feature engineering
next split data into train, test, validation data
in here we can do k-fold cross validation
next Train model with train data
in this step we can see overfitting or underfitting
then we can go back to preprocessing, feature engineering, modify model, 
modfiy hyper parameters to make a better model
next Evaluate model with test data
but score is bad we can repeat pipeline

we learned different algorithms in ai/ml
supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement
in supervised, put input data, expected output
in unsupervised put only input data
in semi-supervised put both input expected output and input data only
in reinforcement put input data expected output and using feedback loop

in supervised learning
in classification you can use logisitc regression 
in regression you can use linear regression and polynomial regression
for decision tree, random forest, SVM you can use in both problems
for deep learning there is FFNN and CNN 
and theres many more 

then ?? will take it from here
